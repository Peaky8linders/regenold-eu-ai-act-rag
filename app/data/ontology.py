"""Typed ontology for the EU AI Act knowledge base.

Promotes the previously-implicit entity model (scattered across
``EC_CHECKER_OBLIGATION_MAP`` in :mod:`app.data.kb`,
``_KEYWORD_ENTITY_MAP`` / ``_CLASSIFICATION_TOPICS`` in
:mod:`app.engines.graph_rag`, and ``KEYWORD_TO_ARTICLE`` /
``_AI_ACT_ANCHORS`` in :mod:`app.integrations.regenold.scope`) into a
single typed source of truth.

## Entity types

* :class:`ActorRole` — provider / deployer / importer / distributor /
  authorised representative / downstream provider / notified body /
  affected person. The "role" the user takes in the value chain.
* :class:`RiskClass` — prohibited / high_risk_annex_i / high_risk_annex_iii /
  limited_risk / minimal_risk / gpai / gpai_systemic. The taxonomy
  the regulation uses to gate obligations.
* :class:`Practice` — each Art. 5(1)(a)..(h) prohibited practice + the
  Digital Omnibus 9th prohibition (CSAM/NCII) as a first-class entity.
* :class:`AnnexIIICategory` — each of the 8 high-risk use-case
  categories from Annex III.
* :class:`Phase` — applicability timeline phases (2 Feb 2025, 2 Aug
  2025, 2 Aug 2026, 2 Aug 2027, Digital Omnibus deferrals).

## Relationship types

Relationships are typed pointers between entities, modelled as tuple
fields on the dataclasses (each side knows its peers). The route's
retrieval engine can traverse these without a graph DB.

* ``Practice → Article`` (primary anchor — typically Art. 5 + sub-paragraph)
* ``Practice → ExemptionContext`` (workplace-only, medical-safety, narrow
  judicial authorisation, etc.)
* ``AnnexIIICategory → Article`` (Art. 6.2 + Annex III + Chapter III Section 2)
* ``RiskClass → Article`` (which articles enumerate the class)
* ``ActorRole → Article`` (which obligations apply to the role)
* ``Phase → Article`` (which obligations come into force at the phase)

## Why this exists

Three reasons (from the May 2026 audit triple):

1. **Eliminates duplication** between the four lookup maps. Each
   entry now exists in one place; the legacy maps become derived
   views in a later refactor pass.
2. **Enables role × system_type → obligations matrix queries** without
   adding more regex topics. Today's `_CLASSIFICATION_TOPICS` has 18
   hand-curated entries; a typed query against this ontology can
   answer arbitrarily many compositional questions.
3. **Surfaces the schema** so an outside reviewer (regulator, partner,
   future engineer) can audit "what does the system believe about the
   EU AI Act?" by reading one file. See ``docs/ontology/ONTOLOGY.md``
   for the human-readable schema.

The ontology is intentionally additive — existing
``EC_CHECKER_OBLIGATION_MAP`` rows and ``_CLASSIFICATION_TOPICS`` entries
stay live and the engine prefers them when they fire. The ontology
is the new source-of-truth for everything we add from here on, and
the legacy maps will be migrated into derived views in a follow-up.
